\subsection{One-Dimensional Case}
We consider problem \eqref{eq:GeneralModel} in case $d = 1$. Given $f,g \colon \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, an interval $D = \left[l,r\right]$ and a Brownian motion $W(t)$, let us consider the following one dimensional SDE
\begin{equation}\label{eq:OneDModel}
\left \{
\begin{aligned}
	dX(t) &= f(X(t)) dt + g(X(t))dW(t), && 0 < t \leq T, \\
	X(0)  &= X_0, && X_0 \in D.
\end{aligned} \right .
\end{equation}
In this case, the boundary of $D$ consists of the two points $\{l,r\}$. In order for the problem of the determination of $\tau$ to be meaningful, at least one of the two points should be endowed with a killing boundary condition.
