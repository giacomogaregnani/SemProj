\subsubsection{Numerical experiments - Estimation of $\Phi$}

\textbf{Smooth case.} We consider \eqref{eq:OneDModel} with $D = \left[ -1, 1 \right]$, the final time $T = 1$ and we define
\begin{align}\label{eq:FunctionsOneDSmoothPhi}
\begin{split}
	f(x) &= -V'(x), \text{ where } V(x) = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + x + 2, \\
	g(x) &= \sigma = 1.5.
\end{split}
\end{align}
As in the approximation of $\tau$, we perform a Montecarlo simulation over $M = 10000$ trajectories. We consider $N = 2^i, i = 5,6,\dots,12$ and we compare the value of the exit probability given by DEM and CEM, comparing it with the value of the solution given by Finite Differences for $X_0 = 0$.
