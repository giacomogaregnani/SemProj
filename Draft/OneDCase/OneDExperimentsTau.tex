\subsubsection{Numerical experiments - Estimation of $\tau$}

We consider as a domain for \eqref{eq:OneDModel} the interval $D = \left[-1,1\right]$, final time $T = 5$ and the following functions
\begin{align}\label{eq:FunctionsOneDSmooth}
\begin{split}
	f(x) &= -V'(x), \text{ where } V(x) = 0.1(8x^4 - 8x^2 + x + 2), \\
	g(x) &= \sigma = 3.
\end{split}
\end{align}
We approximate the value of $\tau$ with a Montecarlo simulation of $\tau_h^d$ and $\tau_h^c$ computed as in \eqref{eq:TauDEM} and \eqref{eq:TauCEM} from the solutions provided by DEM and CEM respectively. In order to verify the order of convergence of the methods, we let $N$ vary in the set $2^i,i=3,\dots,12$ and we fix the number of trajectories $M$ to $10000$. In this way, the error caused by the Montecarlo estimation should not spoil the order of convergence. In Figure \ref{fig:OrdersOneD} we show the errors obtained fixing $X_0 = 0$ in both the cases of killing and reflecting boundary conditions in $x = 1$. Moreover, in Figure \ref{fig:ApproxOneD} we show an approximation of $\tau$ obtained with the two methods with $h = T/128$ and $M = 1000$ for a set of 10 initial values equispaced along $D$. It is possible to remark that computing the probability of exit between two consecutive timesteps as in \eqref{eq:CEMProbHalfSpace} allows correcting the overestimation of $\tau$ obtained simply using DEM. We want to estimate the computational time for both the method. We consider $M = 10000$, killing boundary conditions and $N = 2^i, i = 3,\dots,12$. We remark that the computational time required by CEM is higher than for DEM if the same value of $h$ is employed. On the other hand, fixing the error, CEM is faster than DEM in this case.

\noindent\textbf{Rough case.} We consider the same domain $D$ as above, $T = 5$ and $g = \sigma = 3$. We consider $V$ to be piecewise linear, so that $f = -dV$ is piecewise constant. In particular, we choose the following form for $V$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FunctionsOneDRough}
V = 0.1 
\left \{
\begin{aligned}
	 -2x -1&, && x < -0.5, \\
	 4x + 2&, && -0.5 \leq x < 0, \\
	 -2x + 2&, &&  0 \leq x < 0.5, \\
	 4x - 1&, && x \geq 0.5.
\end{aligned} \right .
\end{equation}
This is a linear interpolation of the function $V$ we used in the smooth case above in the points $\{-1,-0.5,0,0.5,1\}$. This case is of particular interest, since if the function $f$ is the result of a numerical method on a $PDE$, it could not be smooth as in the previous case. We perform DEM and CEM with the same parameters as before, \textit{i.e.}, $M = 10000, N = 2^i,i=3,\dots,12$. In Figure \ref{fig:OrdersOneDRough} it is possible to remark that the rate of convergence of DEM is unvaried with respect to the previous case. The CEM method experiences a slight decrease in the order of convergence with respect to the smooth case.
