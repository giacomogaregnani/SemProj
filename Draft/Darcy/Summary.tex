\subsection{Summary}

Let us summarize the procedure we use for approximating the solution of \eqref{eq:GeneralDarcySDE}. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Generate $A$ on a grid with spacing $\Delta_A$ with a Fourier transform method.
	\item Approximate the solution of \eqref{eq:DarcyProblem} with the Finite Element methods on a fine triangulation $T_p$ with maximum element size $\Delta_p$.
	\item Compute the velocity field from the FEM solution and interpolate it on a grid with spacing $\Delta_u$ to obtain a piece-wise constant field $\tilde{u}$.
	\item Solve \eqref{eq:GeneralDarcySDE} with DEM or CEM to evaluate the mean exit time $\bar\tau$ using $\tilde{u}$ as the transport field.
\end{enumerate}
