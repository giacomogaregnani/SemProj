\subsection{Estimation of the exit time}

The numerical and theoretical path we followed in the previous paragraphs enables us to build a Montecarlo simulation using which we estimate the mean exit time from a domain with the solution of the uncertain Darcy problem as a transport field. All consideration above allow us performing efficiently and accurately the estimation of the exit time \textit{for each realization} of the Darcy problem. Therefore, it is sufficient to average over different realizations of the Darcy problem in order to obtain an estimation of the exit time, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:MCofMC}. We consider the square domain $D = [-1, 1]^2$ and the following values for the parameters
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random field: $\nu = 0.5, L_C = 0.05, \sigma_A = 1, \Delta_A = 0.0039$,
	\item Darcy problem: $p_0 = 1$,
	\item Finite Elements solution: $\Delta_p = 5\cdot 10^{-3}$,
	\item Interpolation: $\Delta_u = 0.0625$,
	\item Trajectories: $X_0 = \begin{pmatrix} -0.8, & 0 \end{pmatrix}^T,  T = 20$,
\end{itemize}

\noindent We vary the value of $\sigma$ and generate 100 solutions of the Darcy problem for each value of $\sigma$, estimating the exit time with 10000 trajectories for each realization. The results we obtain are the following 

\begin{center}
 	\begin{tabular}{|c c|} 
 	\hline
 	$\sigma$ & $\tau$ \\ [0.5ex] 
 	\hline\hline
	$1\cdot10^0$ & 0.4718 \\ 
 	\hline
 	$1\cdot10^{-1}$ & 3.9437 \\
 	\hline
 	$1\cdot10^{-2}$ & 4.2634 \\
 	\hline
	$1\cdot10^{-3}$ & 3.9767 \\
	\hline
	$1\cdot10^{-4}$ & 3.9906 \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\noindent We remark that in the transport-dominated case the exit time stabilizes on a value of approximately four seconds.
