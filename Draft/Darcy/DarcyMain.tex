\section{The uncertain Darcy problem}
The two methods for approximating the mean exit time have been investigated in a general frame. In the following we will consider \eqref{eq:GeneralModel} with $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ given by the solution of the uncertain Darcy problem. 

\subsection{Problem statement}
Let us consider a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Let us define the Neumann boundaries of $D$ as $\Gamma_N$, its inlet boundary as $\Gamma_{in}$ and its outlet boundary as $\Gamma_{out}$. Then, we search the solution of the following problem
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:DarcyProblem}
	\left \{
  	\begin{aligned}
		u &= -A \nabla p, && \text{in } D, \\
		\nabla\cdot u &= 0, && \text{in } D, \\
		p &= p_0, && \text{on } \Gamma_{in},\\
		p &= 0, && \text{on } \Gamma_{out}, \\
		\nabla p &= 0, && \text{on } \Gamma_N,
	\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a random field. The solution $u$ of this equation is used as transport field in equation \eqref{eq:GeneralModel}, which can be therefore written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GeneralDarcySDE}
  	\left \{
  	\begin{aligned}
    		dX(t) &= u(X) dt + \sigma dW(t), && 0 < t \leq T, \\
    		X(0)  &= X_0, 	 	     && X_0 \in D,
  	\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation} 

where we set the boundary conditions to be reflecting on $\Gamma_N$ and killing on both $\Gamma_{in},\Gamma_{out}$.
