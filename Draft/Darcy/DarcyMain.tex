\section{Darcy problem}
The two methods for approximating the mean exit time have been investigated in a general frame. In the following we will consider \ref{eq:GeneralModel} with $f\colon \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ given by the solution of the uncertain Darcy problem. 

\subsection{Problem statement}
Let us consider a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Let us define the Neumann boundaries of $D$ as $\Gamma_N$, its inlet boundary as $\Gamma_{in}$ and its outlet boundary as $\Gamma_{out}$. Then, we search the solution of the following problem
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:DarcyProblem}
	\begin{cases}
		u = -A \nabla p, & \text{in } D, \\
		\nabla\cdot u = 0, & \text{in } D, \\
		p = p_0, & \text{on } \Gamma_{in},\\
		p = 0, & \text{on } \Gamma_{out}, \\
		\nabla p = 0, & \text{on } \Gamma_N,
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a random field. The equation is solved using Finite Elements, thus retrieving an approximate solution $u_h$ of the velocity field. Then, given $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ we consider the following SDE in the same domain $D$
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:GeneralDarcySDE}
	\begin{cases}
		dX(t) = u_h(X) dt + \sigma dW(t), & 0 < t \leq T, \\
		X(0) = X_0, X_0 \in D,
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where we set the boundary conditions to be reflecting on $\Gamma_N$ and killing on both $\Gamma_{in},\Gamma_{out}$.
