\subsection{Solution of the Darcy problem}

We consider as the domain $D = [-1,1] \times [-1,1]$. The random field $A$ in \eqref{eq:DarcyProblem} is generated on an uniform grid using a covariance function belonging to the Matern family as in \cite{Nobile2015}. The boundaries given by $y = \pm 1$ identify $\Gamma_N$, the boundary in $x = -1$ is $\Gamma_{in}$ with $p_0 = 1$ and the boundary in $x = 1$ is $\Gamma_{out}$. The Finite Element solution $u_h$ is computed on a mesh $T_h$.
