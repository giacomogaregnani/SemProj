\section{Darcy problem}
We consider the Darcy problem in a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. Let us define the Neumann boundaries of $D$ as $\Gamma_N$, its inlet boundary as $\Gamma_{in}$ and its outlet boundary as $\Gamma_{out}$. Then, we search the solution of the following problem
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:DarcyProblem}
	\begin{cases}
		u = -A \nabla p, & \text{in } D, \\
		\nabla\cdot u = 0, & \text{in } D, \\
		p = p_0, & \text{on } \Gamma_{in},\\
		p = 0, & \text{on } \Gamma_{out}, \\
		\nabla p = 0, & \text{on } \Gamma_N,
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a random field generated as in \cite{Nobile2015}.
