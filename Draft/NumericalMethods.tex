\subsection{Numerical Methods}

\subsubsection{Discrete Euler-Maruyama}
Given $N \in \mathbb{N}$ let us define a partition of $[0,T]$ as $P_h = \{t_i\}_{i=0}^{N}, t_i = ih, h = T/N$. The Discrete Euler-Maruyama method (DEM) for problem \eqref{eq:GeneralModel} is defined as follows
\begin{equation}\label{eq:DEM}
	\left \{
	\begin{aligned}
		X_{h,i+1}^d &= f(X_{h,i}^d)h + g(X_{h,i}^d)(W(t_{i+1}) - W(t_{i})),  \\
		X_{h,0}^d &= X_0.
	\end{aligned} \right .
\end{equation} 
The exit time $\tau$ is approximated with the quantity $\tau_h^d$ defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TauDEM}
	\tau_h^d = \min\{\tau_{h,e}^d,T\}, \text{ where } \tau_{h,e}^d = h\min \{i \colon X_{h,i}^d \notin D\}.
\end{equation}
We approximate analogously $\phi$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PhiDEM}
	 \phi_h^d = \mathbbm{1}_{\{T < \tau_{h,e}^d\}}F(X_{h,N}^d).
\end{equation}
It has been shown \cite{Gobet2000, Gobet2010, Higham2013} that under appropriate assumptions on the functions $f$ and $g$, as well as the domain $D$ and its boundary, the weak error of the method for approximating the values of interest is of order 1/2, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}\label{eq:ConvDEMTau}
	|\mathbb{E}(\tau_h^d) - \mathbb{E}(\tau)| &= O(\sqrt{h}), \\
	|\mathbb{E}(\phi_h^d) - \mathbb{E}(\phi)| &= O(\sqrt{h}).
\end{align}	
It is known that the weak error for Euler-Maruyama is of order 1, therefore there is a loss of 1/2 in case of killing and reflecting boundaries \cite[Chapter 14]{Kloeden1992}. This is due to the missed exits, \textit{i.e.}, a part of the solution which lays outside the domain connecting two discrete values that are inside the domain. An example of a missed exit is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:MissedExit}, where the solution computed with a large step size $h$ stays in the domain, while with a smaller step size one can conclude that the solution has actually exited the domain. The methods that we present in the following implement two different strategies to correct this behaviour.

\subsubsection{Continuous Euler-Maruyama. }
Let us consider the partition $P_h$ of $[0,T]$ as above. The Continuous Euler-Maruyama (CEM) method is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CEM}
	\left \{
	\begin{aligned}
		X_h^c(t) &= f(X_h^c(t_i))(t-t_i) + g(X_h^c(t_i))(W(t) - W(t_{i})),  && t_i < t \leq t_{i+1},\\
		X_h^c(0) &= X_0.
	\end{aligned} \right .
\end{equation} 
Let us remark that in case the particle does not exit the domain, $X_h^c(t_i) = X_{h,i}^d$ for all $t_i \in P_h$. It is possible to compute the probability that a particle has exited the domain at a time $t$ between two consecutive timesteps $t_i,t_{i+1}$ when $D$ is an half-space with the following formula \cite{Gobet2001}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CEMProb}
	\Pr (\exists t \in [ t_i,t_{i+1} ] \quad X_h^c(t) \notin D | X_h^c(t_i) = x_i, X_h^c(t_{i+1}) = x_{i+1}) = p(x_i,x_{i+1},h),
\end{equation}
with $p(x_i,x_{i+1},h)$ given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CEMProbHalfSpace}
	p(x_i,x_{i+1},h) = \exp\Big(-2\frac{[n\cdot(x_i - z_i)][n\cdot(x_{i+1} - z_i)]}{hn\cdot (gg^T(x_i)n)}\Big),
\end{equation}
where $z_i$ is the projection of $x_i$ on $\partial D$ and $n$ is the vector normal to $\partial D$ in $z_i$ pointing outwards $n$. At each timestep $t_{i+1}$ we compute the probability $p(x_i,x_{i+1},h)$, and then simulate a variable $U$ distributed uniformly in the interval $\left[0,1\right]$, thus obtaining a realization $\tilde U$. Hence, we conclude that the particle has left the domain for a time $t$ in $(t_i,t_{i+1})$ if $\tilde U$ is smaller than $p$. This step guarantees that the method proceeds in a stochastic fashion, well suited to simulate a stochastic process. Therefore, we approximate the exit time as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:TauCEM}
\begin{aligned}
	\tau_h^c &= \min \{T,\tau_{h,e}^c\}, \\
	\text{ where } \tau_{h,e}^c &= \min\{h\min\{i \colon X_h^c(t_i) \notin D\}, h\min\{i \colon \tilde U < p(X_h^c(t_{i-1}),X_h^c(t_i),h) \}\}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In the same way as in DEM, we can approximate $\phi$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PhiCEM}
	\phi_h^c = \mathbbm{1}_{\{T < \tau_{h,e}^c\}}F(X_h^c(T)).
\end{equation}
We show the pseudo-code for the implementation of CEM in Algorithm \ref{alg:algoCEM}. It has been shown \cite{Gobet2010} that under appropriate assumptions on the functions $f$ and $g$, as well as the domain $D$ and its boundary, the weak error of this method when approximating the values of interest is 1, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{align}\label{eq:ConvCEMPhi}
	|\mathbb{E}(\tau_h^c) - \mathbb{E}(\tau)| = O(h), \\
	|\mathbb{E}(\phi_h^c) - \mathbb{E}(\phi)| = O(h).
\end{align}
This result implies that computing the probability of exit at each timestep it is possible to avoid the phenomenon of the missed exits, restoring the weak order 1 of the standard Euler-Maruyama method. Let us remark that the complexity of CEM for computing a single time step is higher than for DEM, as the probability has to be computed for each part of the boundary of $D$ and compared with $\tilde U$. On the other side, it is likely that CEM terminates before DEM, as the exit could be detected at an earlier stage.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\caption{Continuous Euler-Maruyama}
\For{$t_i \in P_h$ }{
	$X(t_{i+1}) = f(X(t_i))h + g(X(t_i))(W(t_{i+1})-W(t_i))$ \;
  	\eIf{$X(t_{i+1}) \notin D$}{
    		$\tau_h^c = t_{i+1}$ \;
		$\phi_h^c = 0$ \;
		\Return
   	}{
   	compute $p = p(x_i,x_{i+1},h)$ \;
	draw $\tilde U$ from $U \sim$ Unif$(0,1)$ \;
	\If{$\tilde U < p$}{
		$\tau_h^c = t_{i+1}$ \;
		$\phi_h^c = 0$ \;
		\Return
		}
  	}
	$\tau_h^c = T$ \;
	$\phi_h^c = F(X_h^c(T))$ \;
 }
\label{alg:algoCEM}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Reflecting boundaries}
The reflecting boundaries are treated in the same way for both DEM and CEM. Let us denote by $\Gamma_k$ and $\Gamma_r$ the killing and reflecting subsets of $\partial D$, \textit{i.e.},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Boundaries}
	\Gamma_r \cup \Gamma_k = \partial D, \quad \Gamma_r \cap \Gamma_k = \emptyset
\end{equation} 
If for a timestep of $t_i \in P_h$, $X(t_i)$ is not in $D$ and the line connecting $X(t_{i-1})$ and $X(t_{i})$ crosses $\Gamma_r$, we update the solution to be the normal reflection inside $D$ of $X(t_i)$. Let us denote by $\tilde X(t_i)$ the new guess for the solution at time $t = t_i$. One has to consider the case in which $\tilde X(t_i)$ is outside $D$ as well. In this case, if the line connecting $X(t_{i-1})$ and $X(t_i)$ crosses $\Gamma_k$, the algorithm terminates. On the other hand, if it has crossed another portion of $\Gamma_r$, another reflection has to be performed, and the procedure explained above repeated. This procedure does not spoil the correctness of the numerical solution \cite{Helmuth}.
