\subsubsection{A space and time adaptive procedure}\label{sec:Adapt}

Let us consider the function $g$ in \eqref{eq:GeneralModel} to be fixed to a real constant $\sigma$. The numerical methods we presented can be completed with an adaptive procedure for the step size $h$ \cite{Giles2016}. In this frame, adaptivity is performed with respect to the position of the numerical solution $X_h(t_i)$, \textit{i.e.}, the step size is reduced if the solution is near to the boundary of the domain $D$. If we denote by $d$ the distance between $X_h(t_i)$ and its normal projection on $\partial D$, by $l \in \N$ a fixed parameter and by $h_0$ a maximum bound for $h$, the step size is chosen using the following formula \cite{Giles2016}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Adaptivity}
	h = \max\Big\{ 2^{-2l}h_0, \min\Big\{ 2^{-l}h_0, \Big(\frac{d}{(l + 3)\sigma}\Big)^2\Big\}\Big\}.
\end{equation}
This formula is equivalent to dividing the domain $D$ in three zones, in particular
\begin{itemize}
	\item an interior zone where $h = h_{int} = 2^{-l}h_0$,
	\item a boundary zone where $h = h_{bound} = 2^{-2l}h_0$,
	\item an intermediate zone where $h = \Big(\frac{d}{(l + 3)\sigma}\Big)^2$.
\end{itemize}
Since the loss of $0.5$ in the weak order of convergence of Euler-Maruyama is given by the missed exits, the convergence issue of DEM is due to the values of the solution near the boundary. Therefore, refining the step size only near to the boundary could lead to an error equal to the one obtained using a fine step size on the whole domain.
