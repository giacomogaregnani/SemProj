\section{Expected exit time from a domain}
We aim to estimate the exit time of a particle driven by a deterministic transport field and a stochastic diffusion from a domain $D \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Given a vector $W(t)$ of $m$ independent Brownian motions and two functions $f\colon \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d, g \colon \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d\times m}$, we consider the following stochastic differential equation (SDE)
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GeneralModel}
\begin{cases}
	dX(t) = f(X(t)) dt + g(X(t))dW(t), & 0 < t \leq T, \\
	X(0)  = X_0, & X_0 \in D.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The problem is completed with two different types of boundary conditions, namely
\begin{itemize}
	\item[i.]  \textit{killing boundaries}: if the particle exits $D$ the process is stopped,
	\item[ii.] \textit{reflecting boundaries}: the particle trajectory is reflected normally inside $D$ when it touches the boundary $\partial D$.
\end{itemize}
Our aim is to estimate numerically the first exit time of the solution $X(t)$ from $D$, \textit{i.e.}, the quantity
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GeneralTau}
	\tau = \min\{\min\{t\colon X(t)\notin D\},T\}.
\end{equation}
Let us remark that the parameter $\tau$ is meaningful only if there exists a portion of the boundary $\Gamma_k \subset \partial D$ that is endowed with killing boundary conditions. Otherwise, the process $X(t)$ will stay in $D$ for the whole time interval, giving as a result $\tau = T$ for each realisation of $X(t)$. Another quantity of interest is defined as follows
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GeneralPhi}
	\phi = \phi(T,X_0,F) = \mathbbm{1}_{\{\tau<T\}}F(X(T)),
\end{equation}
where $F\colon \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a smooth function. An interesting choice of $F$ could be the function mapping every $x$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ to the value 1. In this case, the expecation of $\phi$ is equal to the probability for $X(t)$ to exit the domain before the final time $T$. Let us choose the notation $F = 1$ in this case, getting
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ExitProb}
	\Phi(T,X_0) = \mathbb{E}(\phi(T,X_0,1)) = \Pr(\tau < T | X(0) = X_0)
\end{equation}
In the case of general $f,g$ and for a $d$-dimensional SDE, there is no closed form for $\tau$ and $\phi$. Therefore, we approximate the value of $\tau$ by means of two numerical schemes, briefly presented in the following.
