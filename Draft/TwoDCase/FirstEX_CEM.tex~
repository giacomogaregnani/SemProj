\subsection{Continuous Euler Method}
The second method we consider is the continuous Euler-Maryuama method. Mantaining the notation employed previously, the solution $X_h^c$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{cases}
		X_h^d(t) = -A(X_h^d(t_i)-\mu)(t-t_i) + \sigma (W(t) - W(t_{i})), \quad A\in \mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}, t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \\
		X_h^d(0) = X_0, \quad X_0 \in D.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
