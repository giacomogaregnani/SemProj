\subsection{Continuous Euler Method}
The second method we consider is the continuous Euler-Maryuama method. Mantaining the notation employed previously, the numerical solution $X_h^d$ is defined as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:continuous_EM}
	\begin{cases}
		X_h^d(t) = -A(X_h^d(t_i)-\mu)(t-t_i) + \sigma (W(t) - W(t_{i})), \quad A\in \mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}, t_i \leq t < t_{i+1} \\
		X_h^d(0) = X_0, \quad X_0 \in D.
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The method is based on the same points produced by \eqref{eq:discrete_EM}, but it takes into account the probability of exit of the particle between time $t_{i}$ and $t_{i+1}$. Given the points $X_h^d(t_{i+1}),X_h^d(t_i)$, the particle trajectory between those two points is a Brownian bridge. In the case of an half-space domain $D$ the probability of exit is computable and given by the formula \cite{Gobet2001}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:exit_probability}
	\mathbb{P} (\exists t \in [ t_i,t_{i+1} ] \quad X_h^d(t) \notin D | X_h^d(t_i) = x_i, X_h^d(t_{i+1}) = x_{i+1}) = p(x_i,x_{i+1},h),
\end{equation}
where $p(x_i,x_{i+1},h)$ is easy to compute for the simple geometry $D$ and the problem defined by \eqref{eq:reference_equation} we consider in this numerical experiment and is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:halfspace_probability}
	p(x_i,x_{i+1},h) = \exp\Big(-2\frac{[n\cdot(x_i - z_i)][n\cdot(x_{i+1} - z_i)]}{\sigma^2h}\Big),
\end{equation}
where $z_i$ is the normal projection of $x_i$ on $\partial D$ and $n$ is the normal to $\partial D$. Therefore, provided the couple $(x_i,x_{i+1})$, we draw at each timestep a Bernoulli variable of parameter $p(x_i,x_{i+1},h)$, concluding that the particle has gone out of $D$ when this quantity is greater than 0.5. We then compute the quantities
\begin{align}\label{eq:estimates_CEM}
\begin{split}
	\tau_h^c &= \min \{T,\hat\tau_h^c \}, \quad \hat\tau_h^c = \min\{t_i = hi, i = 1,\dots, N \colon X_h(t_i) \notin D \text{ or } p(x_{i-1},x_i,h) > 0.5 \}, \\
	\phi_h^c &= \mathbbm{1}_{\hat\tau_h^c > T}.
\end{split}
\end{align}
We estimate then the error with
\begin{align}\label{eq:error_CEM}
\begin{split}
	err_h^{\tau,c} &= | \tau_h^c - \tau |, \\
	err_h^{\phi,c} &= | \phi_h^c - \phi |,
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $\tau$ and $\phi$ are computed as in \eqref{eq:estimates_exact}. For this numerical scheme, the error is expected to be $O(h)$ \cite{Gobet2001}.
