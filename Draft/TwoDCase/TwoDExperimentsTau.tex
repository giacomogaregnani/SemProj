\noindent \textbf{Estimation of the exit time.} We consider a simple case of \eqref{eq:GeneralModel} in $D = [-1,1]^2$, where
\begin{equation*}
	f = 0 \in \R^2, \; g = \sigma I\in \R^{2\times 2}, \sigma \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation*}
Moreover, we consider $\partial D$ to be a killing boundary. The solution in this case is a Brownian motion. In this case, the partial differential equation \eqref{eq:PDETau} reduces to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PDETau2DKilling}
	\left \{
  	\begin{aligned}
	- \sigma^2 \Delta \bar \tau &= 2, && \text{in } D, \\
	\bar \tau &= 0, && \text{on } \partial D.
	\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation}
This is the Poisson equation, hence it is possible to solve it numerically with the Finite Elements Method or the finite differences avoiding a high computational cost. We use the Finite Elements Method adopting a regular mesh with equal constant spacing in the $x$ and $y$ directions, obtaining a solution as in Figure \ref{fig:TauExact2DKill}. In order to verify the orders of convergence of DEM and CEM, we set $T = 3$, $\sigma = 1$, $X_0 = (0,0)^T$, with $M = 10^4$ and $N = 2^i,i=3,\dots,9$. We then compare the Montecarlo estimation with the value of $\bar\tau$ in $(0,0)$, obtained by an evaluation of the Finite Elements solution. The orders of convergence for this numerical experiment are shown in Figure \ref{fig:KillTwoD}. The results confirm the theoretical orders of convergence for DEM and CEM, with an average order of 0.55 for DEM and 0.93 for CEM, which corrects to 0.98 if the last point is not taken into account.

We consider the same problem as above with mixed killing and reflecting boundary conditions. The functions $f$ and $g$ are the same as above, so the SDE model does not change, but we consider the two left and right boundaries of $D$, defined by $x = \pm 1$, to be reflecting. We denote this portion of the boundary as $\Gamma_r$, and the rest as $\Gamma_k$. In this case, the equation for $\bar\tau$ becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:PDETau2DKilling}
	\left \{
  	\begin{aligned}
	- \sigma^2 \Delta \bar \tau &= 2, && \text{in } D, \\
	\bar \tau &= 0, && \text{on } \Gamma_k, \\
	\partial \bar \tau \cdot n &= 0, && \text{on } \Gamma_r.
	\end{aligned} \right.
\end{equation}
The solution of this equation obtained with the Finite Elements Method is shown in Figure \ref{fig:TauExact2DRefl}. We compute the expectation of $\tau$ with DEM and CEM with the same parameters as above. Results (Figure \ref{fig:ReflTwoD}), show that the theoretical orders of convergence are not spoiled by this choice of boundary conditions. The mean order for DEM in this case is 0.55, while for CEM it is 1.15.
