\frametitle{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We verified the properties of three numerical methods for estimating the mean exit time and the exit probability.
	\item The Continuous Euler-Maruyama offers the best performances and accuracy among the studied methods.
	\item We studied the effect of a perturbation term in the analytic and numerical solution of an SDE.
	\item If an interpolation step is performed, the step size for time integration must be balanced with the interpolation grid size.
	\item We applied the studied techniques to the Darcy's problem, leading to a stable and efficient nested Montecarlo simulation.
	\item Future developments could regard integrating MLMC techniques in outer or inner Montecarlo estimation, as well as integrating the modeling of extraction wells.
